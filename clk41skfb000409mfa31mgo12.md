# **ðŸŒŸ** Introduction

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a secure and customizable virtual network for organizations such as (schools). Let's dive into what AWS VPC is, explore its real-life applications with an example related to schools and students, and understand the key components such as internet gateways, subnets, load balancers, NACLs, route tables, security groups, and NAT gateways â€“ all explained with emojis and bullet points for easy understanding! ðŸš€ðŸ“š

# **ðŸŒŸ** What is AWS VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that lets you create and manage a logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud environment. It allows schools to define their own network settings, control traffic, and securely deploy resources for various educational applications.

# **ðŸŒŸ** Components of AWS VPC

### **âœ” Subnets**:

A subnet can be thought of as <mark>dividing</mark> a <mark>large network</mark> into <mark>smaller networks</mark>. This is done because the maintenance of smaller networks is easier and it also <mark>provides security</mark> to the network from other networks.

### **âœ” Route Tables**:

A route table contains a <mark>set of rules </mark> called <mark>routes</mark> which determine where <mark>traffic has to be directed</mark>. You can have multiple route tables in a VPC.

### **âœ” Internet Gateways (IGW)**:

It is a combination of hardware and software that provides your private networks with a route to the world outside. An IGW is a <mark>horizontally scaled</mark>, redundant and <mark>highly available VPC component</mark> that allows <mark>communication</mark> between <mark>instances</mark> and the <mark>internet</mark>. <mark>Only one IGW can be attached to a VPC at a time.</mark>

### **âœ” Network Address Translation (NAT)**:

A subnet is private, the IP addresses assigned to the instances cannot be used in public. NAT <mark>maps</mark> the <mark>private IP</mark> addresses to the <mark>public address</mark> on the way out and vice versa on the way in. An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can associate an Elastic IP address with any instance or network interface for any VPC in your account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your VPC.

### **âœ” Security groups**:

Security groups are a set of <mark>firewall rules</mark> that controls the traffic for your instance. In Amazon Firewall the only action that can be carried out is allow. You <mark>cannot create</mark> a <mark>rule to deny</mark>. The destination is always the instance on which the service security group is running. You can have a <mark>single security group</mark> associated with <mark>multiple instances</mark>.

### **âœ”** Load Balancer:

A load balancer is a network device or software component that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources. Its purpose is to optimize resource utilization, improve reliability, and ensure high availability for applications or services.

### **âœ” Customer Gateway**:

An Amazon VPC <mark>VPN connection</mark> links your <mark>data center</mark> (or network) to your <mark>Amazon VPC</mark> (virtual private cloud). A *customer gateway* is an anchor on your side of that connection. It can be a physical or software appliance.

### **âœ” Virtual Private Gateway**:

A *virtual private gateway* is the <mark>VPN concentrator</mark> on the Amazon side of the VPN connection. You create a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC from which you want to create the VPN connection.

### **âœ” VPN stands for â€˜virtual private networkâ€™**:

It is a popular <mark>internet security method</mark> that was originally designed for large organizations where employees needed to <mark>connect to a certain computer</mark> from <mark>different locations</mark>.

### **âœ” VPC Peering**:

A VPC peering connection allows you to <mark>route traffic</mark> between <mark>two VPCâ€™s using</mark> IPv4 or IPv6 <mark>private addresses</mark>. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a <mark>VPC peering connection</mark> between your <mark>own VPCs</mark>, or with a <mark>VPC in another AWS account</mark>. A VPC peering connection helps you to facilitate the <mark>transfer of data</mark>.

### **âœ” Network Access Control Lists (NACL)**:

It is an <mark>optional layer of security</mark> for your <mark>VPC</mark> that acts as a <mark>firewall</mark> for <mark>controlling traffic in and out</mark> of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC. The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets to which it is associated.

# **ðŸŒŸ** Conclusion

AWS provides several efficient, secure connectivity options to help you get the most out of AWS when integrating your remote networks with Amazon VPC. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that youâ€™ve defined.ðŸŽ“
