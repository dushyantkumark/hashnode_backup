# **ðŸŒŸ**Introduction

In this blog post, we will be discussing various aspects of AWS CLI So, this will help us to make different operations via CLI instead of AWS Console which is (GUI).

In this article, we are considering **Windows** machine. But for other OS like Linux/Mac, you can refer to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for the downloading links and commands.

Firstly, you need to have a 64-bit Windows and should have Admin accessing rights.

# **ðŸŒŸ**What is AWS CLI?

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unique tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to <mark>interact with various AWS services from the command line or scripts</mark>. It provides a command-line interface to perform actions, manage resources, and automate tasks across different AWS services.

Using the AWS CLI, you can do:

1. **Manage AWS Services**: You can create, configure, and manage AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon RDS databases, AWS Lambda functions, and more.
    
2. **Control AWS Infrastructure**: You can manage AWS infrastructure components, including virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, security groups, route tables, and network ACLs.
    
3. **Access AWS Services**: You can access and work with AWS services such as Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL database, AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code, AWS IAM for user and access management, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and many more.
    
4. **Automate Tasks**: The AWS CLI allows you to automate tasks by scripting commands and integrating them into your automation workflows or shell scripts. This helps to streamline and simplify repetitive tasks, making it easier to manage and configure AWS resources.
    
5. **Secure and Authenticate**: The AWS CLI supports authentication using AWS access keys, temporary session tokens, or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. It also supports secure communication with AWS services using HTTPS.
    
6. **Configure and Customize**: You can configure the AWS CLI with various settings, including default region, output format, and custom profiles. This allows you to tailor the CLI experience based on your preferences and needs.
