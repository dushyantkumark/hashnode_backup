# Kubernetes Troubleshooting

# **Introduction:**

I am happy to share that I have completed the TWS Kubernetes Challenge, a seven-day journey initiated by Shubham Londhe Sir. This challenge has allowed me to sharpen my skills and gain invaluable knowledge in Kubernetes troubleshooting. It is a powerful container orchestration platform that enables the deployment and management of complex applications. However, like any complex system, it is not immune to issues and challenges. We will delve into Kubernetes troubleshooting and explore essential techniques to effectively diagnose and resolve common problems. We will cover essential Kubectl commands, analyze logs, debug container images and so on.

## **Essential Kubectl Commands for Troubleshooting**

One of the imp key tools in a Kubernetes administrator's arsenal is the `kubectl` which is a command-line interface. Now explore some essential commands for troubleshooting:

## **Checking Cluster Status:**

To ensure the health of your cluster, you can use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl cluster-info
```

This command provides an overview of the cluster, including the Kubernetes API server, control plane components, and many more.

### **Obtaining Cluster Logs:**

To detect deeper issues with your cluster’s nodes, you’ll need access to the nodes’ logs. The table below indicates where to find the logs.

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>NODE TYPE</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>COMPONENT</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>WHERE TO FIND LOGS</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Master</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>API Server</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>/var/log/kube-apiserver.log</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Master</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Scheduler</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>/var/log/kube-scheduler.log</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Master</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Controller Manager</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>/var/log/kube-controller-manager.log</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Worker</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Kubelet</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>/var/log/kubelet.log</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Worker</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Kube Proxy</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>/var/log/kube-proxy.log</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Let’s take a look at some frequent cluster failure situations, their consequences, and how they are generally addressed. This is not a comprehensive guide on cluster troubleshooting, but it will assist you in resolving the most prevalent difficulties.

**API Server VM Shuts Down or Crashes:**

* **Impact:** You will be unable to launch, terminate, or update pods and services if the API server is unavailable.
    
* **Resolution:** Restart the API server virtual machine.
    
* **Prevention:** Set the API server VM to restart automatically, and configure high availability for the API server.
    

**Control Plane Service Shuts Down or Crashes:**

* **Impact:** Because services such as the Replication Controller Manager, Scheduler, and so on are colocated with the API Server, the impact of any of them shutting down or crashing is the same as the API Server shutting down.
    
* **Resolution:** The same as when the API Server VM shuts down.
    
* **Prevention:** The same as when the API Server VM shuts off.
    

**API Server Storage Lost:**

* **Impact:** The API Server will not restart after being shut off.
    
* **Resolution:** Check that the storage is operational again, manually restore the API Server’s state from backup, and restart it.
    
* **Prevention:** Ensure you have a readily available snapshot of the API Server. Use dependable storage, such as Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS), which survives the shutdown of the API Server VM, and prioritizes highly available storage.
    

**Worker Node Shuts Down:**

* **Impact:** If the node’s pods cease running, the Scheduler will try to execute them on other available nodes. The cluster’s total capability to operate pods will be reduced.
    
* **Resolution:** Identify the problem on the node, restart it, and register it with the cluster.
    
* **Prevention:** Use a replication control or a Service in front of pods to guarantee that node failures do not affect users. Create fault-tolerant programs.
    

**Kubelet Malfunction:**

* **Impact:** If a node’s kubelet crashes, you will be unable to create new pods on that node. Existing pods may or may not be removed, and the node will be designated as unhealthy.
    
* **Resolution:** The same as when the Worker Node shuts down.
    
* **Prevention:** The same as when a worker node shuts off.
    

## **Gathering Cluster Information:**

To gather detailed information about your cluster, use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

This command displays information about the nodes in your cluster, including their status, capacity, and IP addresses.

## **Inspecting Pod Status:**

To check the status of your pods within a given namespace, you can use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<namespace>` with the specific namespace you want to inspect. This command provides information about the pods' status, including whether they are running, pending, or have errors.

## **Describing Pods:**

For more detailed information about a specific pod, you can use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of the pod you want to inspect. This command provides in-depth details about the pod's status, events, and container information.

## **Analyzing Logs for Troubleshooting**

Logs play a crucial role in troubleshooting Kubernetes applications. Here's how you can analyze logs effectively:

## **Viewing Pod Logs:**

To view the logs of a specific pod, use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of the pod you want to inspect. This command displays the logs from the specified pod, helping you identify any errors or unexpected behavior.

## **Following Logs in Real-time:**

To continuously monitor the logs of a pod in real time, use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl logs -f <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

This command allows you to follow the logs as they are being generated, providing live updates on the pod's activities.

## **Filtering Logs:**

To filter logs based on specific criteria, you can use the `--selector` flag along with the `kubectl logs` command. For example:

```yaml
kubectl logs -l <label-key>=<label-value> -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<label-key>` and `<label-value>` with the appropriate label key-value pair to filter the logs.

## **Debugging Container Images**

Sometimes, troubleshooting in Kubernetes involves debugging issues within container images. Here are some techniques to aid in the debugging process:

## **Running a Debug Container:**

You can run a debug container within the same pod to investigate issues. Use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl debug <pod-name> -n <namespace> --image=<debug_image>
```

Replace `<pod_name>` and `<namespace>` with the relevant pod and namespace. `<debug_image>` represents the container image that contains debugging tools.

## **Executing Commands in Containers:**

To execute commands within a running container, use the `kubectl exec` command followed by the pod name, namespace, and the command you want to run. Here's an example:

```yaml
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- <command>
```

Replace `<pod_name>` and `<namespace>` with the appropriate values. `<command>` represents the command you want to execute within the container.

## **Accessing Container Logs:**

If you need to inspect the logs of a specific container within a pod, you can use the following command:

```yaml
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> -c <container_name>
```

Replace `<pod_name>`, `<namespace>`, and `<container_name>` with the relevant information. This command displays the logs specifically from the specified container.

## **Conclusion:**

Effective troubleshooting is crucial for maintaining a healthy and reliable Kubernetes environment. By using essential `kubectl` commands, analyzing logs, and debugging container images, you can efficiently identify and resolve issues within your Kubernetes clusters. Remember to practice these techniques in real-world scenarios to gain hands-on experience and enhance your troubleshooting skills.
