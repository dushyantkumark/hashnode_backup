# üåüIntroduction

This article will provide a guide on how to set up a Docker and Jenkins server on an Ubuntu server, covering all the necessary steps to install and configure Jenkins for your needs using Terraform. As DevOps engineers, we need Jenkins to help us automate software development processes, and enable us to build, test, and deploy our applications more quickly and efficiently. You can install, configure and start using Jenkins to quickly automate your software development processes.

## üî±Prerequisite :

Here are some prerequisites for this project are given below:

* Linux
    
* Git and GitHub
    
* Any Cloud Provider in my case, I am using AWS
    
* CI/CD Concept
    
* Jenkins
    
* Docker
    
* Dockerhub
    
* Terraform
    
* AWS Services (EC2, SES, etc.)
    

### üìåIMP NOTE:

This setup is chargeable for some amount, an instance that is am using is t2.medium.

# üåüTask 1: Create IAM User

Let's start the process of setup your instance for the project, follow these steps:

* Log in to your AWS account.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689578669044/44e91216-7100-43ea-bd87-fa17f95a773c.png align="center")
    
* Search for an IAM in the AWS console.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689579012412/9284856b-9ed3-46e0-a3f4-227600b5502a.png align="center")
    
* With IAM, administrators can create users, and assign them unique credentials, such as a username and password or access keys, for **authentication** and also be used to access AWS resources and services.
    
    First, create a user (terraform\_demo), you can provide any name.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691583207570/83c5fdc9-a523-45cf-83c4-b475f3d86fb2.png align="left")
    
* Second, attach a direct policy to the user.

* Third, attach a policy to your user, I am giving administrative access. You can provide those policy permissions which you want to create aws service.

* Fourth, You go to security credentials, then assign the access key and secret access key to your user. After creating keys now you good to go for your terraform code.

# üåüTask 2: Spin up an instance using Terraform Scripts

* Use the CLI to create environment variables that contain your keys. First, make sure you have the Access Key and Secret Key of your AWS user. Follow [**this**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html), if you don't have it.
    
    Once you have your Access Key and Secret Key readily available, run the following commands:
    
    ```plaintext
    aws --version
    aws configure
    #then provide access_key and secret_access_key
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<access_key>"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<secret_key>"
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691584475219/fdf620d5-7b82-418d-9cb9-f14eb0d6a1e7.png align="left")
    
* Create a Directory structure as per your projects.
    

```plaintext
mkdir -p g:/Terraform_Project/Terraform_Jenkins
cd g:/Terraform_Project/Terraform_Jenkins
```

When you‚Äôre in the directory you want to work in, go ahead and create various terraform files. You can do this from the CLI using the `touch` command or by clicking on **File** in the top left, then **New file**, saving the file in the correct directory. I‚Äôve created different files of Terraform and then open <mark>Visual Studio Code</mark> using <mark>code .</mark> command.

> terraform.tf
> 
> variable.tf
> 
> provider.tf
> 
> aws\_sg.tf
> 
> ec2\_instance.tf

* The first step in writing your configuration file is to assign the **Terraform required provider** you want to use.
    
    Create **<mark>"terraform.tf"</mark>** , **<mark>"variable.tf"</mark> and <mark>"provider.tf"</mark>**
    
    ```plaintext
    terraform {
      required_providers {             
        aws = {                          #this is my provider: aws
          source  = "hashicorp/aws"      
          version = "4.67.0"             #version of provider
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ```plaintext
    provider "aws" {
      region = var.aws_region            #your aws region and its value assigned in variable.tf file
    }
    ```
    
    ```plaintext
    variable "ami" {
      default = "ami-0f5ee92e2d63afc18"  #ami from aws ec2 console
    }
    
    variable "vpc_ID" {
      default = "vpc-0aef54445ced2dc34"  #from vpc console
    }
    variable "instance_type" {
      default = "t2.medium"              #from aws ec2 console 
    }
    
    variable "instance_name" {
      default = "Jenkins_Server"         #assign any name
    }
    
    variable "key_pair" {
      default = "Jenkins"                #create key pair from ec2 console and download it.
    }
    
    variable "aws_region" {
      default = "ap-south-1"             #aws-region
    }
    
    variable "jenkins_sg_name" {
      default = "jenkins_security_group"
    }
    ```
    
* For **instance type**, we will not use free-tier instance t2.medium. You can optionally include a tag, and I have given my instance a tag of ‚Äújenkins\_instance‚Äù. So far, our **<mark>"ec2_instance.tf" </mark>** file should look like this:
    
    ```plaintext
    resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
      ami             = var.ami
      instance_type   = var.instance_type
      tags = {
        Name = var.instance_name
      }
      key_name  = var.key_pair
      user_data = file("user_data.sh")
    
    }
    ```
    
    **Bootstrap the EC2 Instance to Install and Start Jenkins and Docker Upon Startup**
    
    In [**Terraform**](https://registry.terraform.io/), the [**user\_data**](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/serverscom/serverscom/latest/docs/guides/user-data) attribute is used to pass data to an instance at launch time. It is specified as a string in the Terraform configuration file and can contain any valid data that is base64-encoded when the instance launches.
    
    Jenkins is an open-source automation server that provides tons of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects. It is a fantastic CI/CD tool to create and manage pipelines for DevOps projects. To learn more about Jenkins, head on over to their website: ([**https://www.jenkins.io/**](https://www.jenkins.io/))
    
    Our team would like to use Jenkins to create pipelines but will need a cloud server to run Jenkins on. To create this server, we will bootstrap Jenkins to an EC2 instance, when the team launches the instance, Jenkins will automatically install and start.
    

The **<mark>"user_data.sh"</mark>** **file** of an EC2 instance is where you can provide a ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù script that will run upon instance startup.

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

#Install Docker
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
#Install Jenkins
#Jenkins requires Java to run, so first install Java -->
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y

#Long-Term Support release of Jenkins---->

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

> You can also use `user_data_replace_on_change = true`
> 
> The `user_data_replace_on_change = true` parameter means that if the user\_data parameter is changed and you run `Terraform apply`, Terraform will terminate the current instance and launch a new one to reflect the new user data script.

### **üî∞Create a Security Group**

Let‚Äôs create our security group that will be assigned to our EC2 instance. To get started, click [**here**](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group) to refer to the hashicorp/aws documentation about security groups. We want the security group to allow traffic on **<mark>port 22</mark>** from my IP address, allow traffic from **<mark>port 8080</mark>** (the default port for Jenkins), allowing traffic from **<mark>port 3000</mark>** for (Weather\_APPLICATION). By default, AWS creates an ‚ÄúAllow All‚Äù egress rule, however, Terraform will delete this default so we need to recreate it using the ‚Äúegress‚Äù block. Enter the following code into the **<mark>"aws_sg.tf"</mark>** file:

```plaintext
resource "aws_security_group" "jenkins_sg" {
  description = "security group used by jenkins_instance"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_ID

  ingress {
    description = "HTTP"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "HTTPS"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "For Jenkins"
    from_port   = 8080
    to_port     = 8080
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "Weather_App"
    from_port   = 3000
    to_port     = 3000
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port        = 0
    to_port          = 0
    protocol         = "-1"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = var.jenkins_sg_name
  }
}
```

### **üî∞Assign the Security Group to the EC2 Instance**

Now that we have the code for our security group, we need to let Terraform know to assign that security group to the EC instance that it will create.

```plaintext
#assign security group
vpc_security_groups_ids = [aws_security_group.jenkins_sg.id]
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691590191759/e75e5236-5b29-4bbc-86bd-c582be145976.png align="center")

### **üî∞Running Terraform Infrastructure**

```plaintext
terraform init
```

This initializes the backend and downloads the plugins you need to run Terraform with AWS.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691590442551/c8e40888-0961-4c0a-9761-87b28ece292a.png align="center")

```plaintext
terraform vaidate
```

This command makes sure the syntax of the &lt;file\_name&gt;.tf file is correct before you create the infrastructure. It checks that the arguments and references are appropriate, that you aren‚Äôt missing any punctuation characters, etc. If you get errors, it will tell you the exact line of the code that needs correcting, so fix it and run `terraform validate` again until it tells you ‚ÄúSuccess!‚Äù.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691590501108/cdaf78ec-5237-4114-84e6-2c1b43a1809c.png align="center")

```plaintext
terraform validate -out "plan.out"
```

The output of **terraform plan** is too much to screenshot, but basically, it will show you what it plans to create. The very last line of output will show a one-line summary of the plan and create a file called <mark>"</mark>**<mark>plan.out"</mark>**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691590570755/41644326-b2c2-475c-8cd7-1cdb7655c4fd.png align="center")

Once the plan appears suitable, run the following command:

```plaintext
terraform apply "plan.out"
```

Similarly, the **terraform apply** command will have a lot of output, too much to screenshot. It will go through each resource as it creates it and let you know how long it‚Äôs taking each resource to create and when the creation is complete. After all of the infrastructure is created, you should see ‚ÄúApply complete!‚Äù.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691590858847/5a6eb0fe-bd40-4d93-8f1e-c91dc1687b58.png align="center")

## **üî±Verify newly created Infrastructure**

You can confirm the creation of all your resources by accessing the AWS console where you will be able to locate the new security group in the VPC console, the new instance in the EC2 console, and the new bucket in the S3 console.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591346187/c61037c4-a426-44ee-9155-2489ce79e454.png align="left")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591309684/cd037c70-ad8c-4305-9ba4-33847480760c.png align="left")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591516431/2c7095fb-d8fb-497a-ba46-72ff86d4280d.png align="left")

## **üî±Verify that You Can Reach Your Jenkins Install via Port 8080 in Your Web Browser**

Please make sure the Status check `shows 2/2 checks passed` for `Jenkins_Server`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591633751/a076e960-0667-48db-b50c-ff174494a8d8.png align="center")

SSH your ec2-instance

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591716195/964d5cbb-9af4-4ab6-9b09-98f147bfcdfb.png align="center")

It looks like it‚Äôs working since we‚Äôre getting some HTML back. Now let‚Äôs see if we can get the Jenkins landing page in a web browser. In your web browser, input this address:

```plaintext
 http://<instance_ip>:8080
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691591850331/66733577-1b5d-477e-971b-6610e1d12797.png align="center")

If you did, Hurray!!! Your Jenkins server is up and running!

* Now Unlock Jenkin with Admin Password by running the below commands
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
    
* By this command, you will get the admin password paste it here and click on continue
    
* Click on Install Suggest Plugins
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685272580832/ad0f269d-63cc-486c-8668-d51994257e80.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="left")
    
* Fill below form to provide a username, Name, Email, and password, click on save and continue.
    
* Congratulation Now Jenkin installation has been completed, Now click on start using Jenkins.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685273005487/27c2dba0-d82c-4ba2-968b-c987eeca5a5b.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="left")

* Jenkin Dashboard will be opened.

## **üî±Clean Up**

To clean up and delete all of the infrastructure resources we created, run the following command:

üî•Terraform Destroy Command is used when you complete your project, this is only a setup process. The next stage is Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with email message (your build is successful with the project name, build number and build log).

```plaintext
terraform destroy
```
