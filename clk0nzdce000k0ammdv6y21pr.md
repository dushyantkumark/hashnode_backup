# **ðŸŒŸ** What is AWS S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a highly scalable and reliable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers a simple web services interface that allows individuals and businesses to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

With AWS S3, you can store and retrieve data objects such as images, videos, documents, and any other type of file. It provides virtually unlimited storage capacity, allowing you to store as much data as you need without worrying about capacity constraints.

S3 offers durability, ensuring that your data is stored redundantly across multiple devices and facilities within an AWS Region. This redundancy minimizes the risk of data loss due to hardware failures or disasters. It also provides high availability, enabling you to access your data whenever you need it.

One of the key advantages of S3 is its scalability. You can start with a small amount of storage and easily expand it as your needs grow. S3 seamlessly handles the increased storage requirements without any disruption to your applications or workflows.

S3 also offers robust security features to protect your data. You can manage access to your data using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, bucket policies, and Access Control Lists (ACLs). Additionally, you can enable server-side encryption to ensure the confidentiality of your data.

AWS S3 integrates well with other AWS services, allowing you to build scalable and cost-effective solutions. For example, you can use S3 with AWS Lambda for serverless computing, Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, or Amazon Athena for data analytics.

## **ðŸŒŸ Different types of data storage in AWS S3?**

You can store virtually any kind of data, in any format, in S3 and when we talk about capacity, the volume and the number of objects that we can store in S3 are unlimited.

\**An object* is the fundamental entity in S3. It consists of data, key and metadata.

When we talk about data, it can be of two types-

* Data which is to be accessed frequently.
    
* Data which is accessed not that frequently.
    

Therefore, Amazon came up with 3 storage classes to provide its customers the best experience and at an affordable cost.

In AWS S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service), different storage classes are available to meet various data storage needs. Here are the different storage classes in S3 with real-time examples:

1. **S3 Standard**: This storage class is suitable for <mark>frequently accessed data</mark> and <mark>real-time applications</mark>. For example, a popular e-commerce website stores its product images and website assets in S3 Standard to ensure fast and reliable access to the images for customers browsing the website.
    
2. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: This storage class automatically moves data between <mark>two tiers based</mark> on access patterns: <mark>frequent access</mark> and <mark>infrequent access</mark>. An example could be a media streaming platform that hosts a vast library of video content. Frequently watched videos are kept in the frequent access tier, while less popular videos are moved to the infrequent access tier, optimizing costs without sacrificing performance.
    
3. **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**: This storage class is ideal for data that is <mark>accessed less frequently</mark> but requires <mark>rapid access when needed</mark>. For instance, a data analytics platform that stores large datasets for periodic analysis may use S3 Standard-IA to efficiently store and retrieve data during analysis runs, while keeping storage costs lower compared to S3 Standard.
    
4. **S3 One Zone-IA**: This storage class is <mark>similar to S3 Standard-IA</mark> but <mark>stores data in a single Availability Zone</mark>. It is suitable for scenarios where data redundancy is not a critical requirement, and cost optimization is a priority. A backup system that stores infrequently accessed data in a single region could use S3 One Zone-IA to save on costs.
    
5. **S3 Glacier**: Glacier is designed for <mark>long-term data archival</mark> with <mark>lower storage costs</mark>. A financial institution might use S3 Glacier to <mark>store historical transaction records</mark> that need to be retained for <mark>regulatory compliance purposes</mark>. Although the data is <mark>rarely accessed</mark>, it can be retrieved when required for auditing or legal requirements.
    
6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: This storage class offers the <mark>lowest storage costs </mark> and is suitable for <mark>rarely accessed and highly cost-sensitive data</mark>. An example could be a research institution that archives large volumes of scientific data, such as genomic sequences or climate data, for future reference. These datasets may have minimal retrieval requirements but need to be stored for extended periods at the lowest cost.
    

# **ðŸŒŸ** Steps to create an S3 bucket

* First <mark>create an account</mark> on AWS. You can create **<mark>AWS Free Tier</mark>** on AWS Cloud, you can create a Free Tier account by going to Google, searching for AWS free tier account and follow the link.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*DchWVmuC_oXpK-Xa3h5lfw.png align="left")

You can create new account by following the link and after that it will ask you for your information; just follow the steps and you are ready to go. It will ask for your card information but its free, so you wonâ€™t be charged for anything if you use only AWS free Tier limit. Or if you already have one you can simple login to your account.

I already have one, so I am going to use my account.

After you logged in go to your <mark>AWS console</mark> and look for service S3. You can search for <mark>S3 </mark> in the search bar or can find it simply by clicking on Services on the left top.

* AWS console screen with recently visited services.
